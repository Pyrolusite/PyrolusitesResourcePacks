{"name":"Pyrolusite's Resource Packs","tagline":"Repository containing everything related to my resource packs for Minecraft and various mods.","body":"# Introduction\r\nWelcome. You can find my modest contributions to Minecraft and its mods here.\r\n\r\nThese resource packs are intended to be modular, which means you can add them to your resource pack list ingame and they will only \"overwrite\" what's needed - provided you place them on top of your other resource packs, ofc.\r\n\r\nI'm still using Mediafire for my download links, but I might host my resource packs on this repository soon.\r\n\r\n# Modern Minimalism\r\n### Download\r\n[Modern Minimalism v0.12 - Minecraft 1.7.10/1.8 (Mediafire)](http://www.mediafire.com/download/hcmzxzt1kdc86zk/modern_minimalism_v0_12.zip)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nSome time ago, I worked on a [GUI](http://i.imgur.com/7laJ2Mn.png) for a GT addon called Modular Powersuits. What it does is self-explanatory, however, I liked what I came up with, so I decided to do the same for the default Minecraft HUD, progressively adding mod support like AppleCore, EnviroMine...\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nImgur album [here](http://imgur.com/a/5POfn).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimalist Technology (GT6 + IC2)\r\n### Download\r\n[Minimalist Technology v0.6 - GT6/IC2 (Mediafire)](http://www.mediafire.com/download/ddp7qx2bbxiga9a/minimalist_technology_v0_6.zip)\r\n[Minimalist Technology NEI module](http://www.mediafire.com/download/44cq1bi24pkc9af/mt_nei_module.zip)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThis is my alternative to GT6 and IC2 Experimental textures.\r\nInitially, I couldn't stand GT5's textures when its alpha came out, so I decided to make my own resource pack for GT5. Since then, I decided to do it with IC2 Experimental as well, but in separate packs (Pyrolusite's GregTech Alternate Textures - PGTAT - and Pyrolusite's IC2 Alternate Textures - PICAT.) Starting to rework both of them since GT6, I decided to merge them into a single resource pack.\r\n\r\nMy textures are inspired from the original ones, while adding my own touch. I tend to use a limited color palette and stick with it for a lot of my work, hence why I consider it \"minimalist\".\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nImgur album [here](http://imgur.com/a/JJkS2).\r\nNEI module [here](http://i.imgur.com/l7uYaqf.png).\r\n\r\n\r\n# Minimalist Technology Legacy (GT5U + IC2)\r\n### Download\r\n[Minimalist Technology Legacy v0.7 - GT5U/IC2 (Mediafire)](http://www.mediafire.com/download/2m9v1nny2g48iv6/minimalist_technology_legacy_v0_7.zip)\r\n[Minimalist Technology NEI module](http://www.mediafire.com/download/44cq1bi24pkc9af/mt_nei_module.zip)\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nMinimalist Technology, but for the GT5 unnoficial continuation - GT5U - maintained by BloodyAsp.\r\nCompatible with GT5E as well.\r\n\r\n### Screenshots\r\nImgur album [here](http://imgur.com/a/T8tVf).\r\nNEI module [here](http://i.imgur.com/l7uYaqf.png).\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  \r\n\r\n# License\r\nAll these resource packs are under a [Creative Commons License - Attribution, Non Commercial, Share Alike 4.0 International -](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/deed.en) which means you can do whatever you want with it as long as you do not make money from it, credit me when using my work for whatever purpose and use the same license.
